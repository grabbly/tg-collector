# Feature Specification: ArchiveDrop

**Feature Branch**: `[001-archive-drop]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Telegram bot to save user text and audio to server folder for later use by a small creator team."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user starts ArchiveDrop, reads a short instruction message, and sends either a text message or an audio/voice note. The bot confirms receipt and saves the content on the server. Each saved entry gets a confirmation ID with a timestamp so the user and maintainers can reference it later.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the user has started the bot, When they send a text message, Then the bot confirms with an ID and the server stores the text and metadata in the date-organized folder.
2. Given the user has started the bot, When they send a voice/audio note, Then the bot confirms with an ID and the server stores the audio file and metadata in the date-organized folder.
3. Given rate limits are configured, When one user sends messages rapidly, Then the bot rejects excess inputs with a clear message and logs the event.
4. Given access control is configured, When a non-allowed user attempts to submit, Then the bot declines and logs the attempt.
5. Given the system is healthy, When a maintainer issues the health-check command, Then the bot replies "OK".

### Edge Cases
- Message arrives with unsupported audio type ‚Üí The bot declines with a help message and logs the event.
- Metadata cannot be written after a payload is saved ‚Üí The bot logs an error and exposes the failure in health checks.
- Storage path is unavailable ‚Üí The bot pauses new writes, returns a temporary error, and logs with clear status.
- Very large message or audio ‚Üí The bot rejects based on configured limits and logs the event.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The bot MUST respond to the start command with a short welcome/instructions message.
- FR-002: The bot MUST accept and save user text messages to the server filesystem.
- FR-003: The bot MUST accept and save user voice or audio messages to the server filesystem.
- FR-004: The bot MUST organize saved messages by date in a structured folder system on the server.
- FR-005: Each saved entry MUST include a metadata JSON with: timestamp (UTC), chat_id, message_id, sender_id (numeric only; no username/full name), type (text|audio), file size, MIME/type, checksum, and storage path.
- FR-006: Filenames MUST be clean and standardized using a deterministic scheme.
- FR-007: The bot MUST ensure reliable, atomic saves to avoid data loss.
- FR-008: The bot MUST support optional access limits to allow only certain users.
- FR-009: The bot MUST rate-limit individual users to prevent abuse.
- FR-010: The bot MUST expose a simple health-check command that responds "OK" when operational.
- FR-011: The bot MUST log important actions (received, saved, errors) in a clear, structured format without storing raw message text or audio in logs.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-001: The system MUST be easy to set up, run, and maintain on a server.
- NFR-002: The system MUST work reliably in both development and production environments.
- NFR-003: Documentation MUST explain setup, configuration, and how to manage stored files.
- NFR-004: The system MUST remain simple and avoid extra features beyond saving and organizing messages in v1.
 - NFR-005: Logs MUST redact sensitive content and exclude raw message bodies to uphold privacy-by-default.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- Submission: Represents a user-submitted item (text or audio) with fields: type, confirmation_id, timestamp (UTC), chat_id, message_id, sender_id (numeric), file size, MIME/type, checksum, and storage path.

---

## Out of Scope (v1)
- No automatic transcription of audio.
- No moderation of content.
- No graphical interface or admin panel.
- No database integration (filesystem only).

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- A user can start the bot and send both text and audio messages.
- The server stores both types of messages in organized, date-based folders.
- Each entry has an accompanying metadata JSON with minimal PII (sender_id only) and required fields.
- The bot responds with a confirmation ID for every message saved.
- Maintainers can verify structured logs reflect received/saved/errors without leaking sensitive content.
